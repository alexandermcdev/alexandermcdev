- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexandermcdev, a product designer keen to understand and work on software and hardware.
- 👀 I’m interested in CSS, Machine Learning, Arduino, Neural Nets, robotics, Swift and much more... to be narrowed down as I find my way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more CSS and frameworks and the use of Github at scale from a design use case.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mobile and Web apps, Saas design with my background in Human Centered Design and UX.
